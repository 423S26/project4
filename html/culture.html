            <h1>The "Friendship Treaty" of 1825</h1>
            </a>
            <p>Meant to ensure longlasting relations between the Crow tribe and the United States government,
                the "Friendship Treaty” of 1825 seems mostly benign on the surface,
                but upon a closer look it becomes clear that this treaty would create a groundwork for the more restrictive treaties in years to come.
                More specifically, it establishes that the tribe resides within the United States,
                and puts them under its protection, effectively beginning the process of removing their status as an independent group with the ability to govern themselves.
                While the treaty did not explicitly remove any rights or make any moves on their territory,
                it ensured that when the United States wanted to, they had a basis to begin encroaching upon the tribe’s territory.

                <h1>The 1851 Treaty of Fort Laramie</h1>
            </a>
                <p>The 1851 Treaty of Fort Laramie was notable in that it allowed the U.S. government to build on Native land,
                    once again creating an erosion of the tribe's independence from the U.S. and allowing for encroachment upon their homes.
                    It also established that the U.S.was responsible for protecting the tribes from “all depredations by the people”,
                    but that the tribes should make reparations for any “depredations” made by their own.
                    Most critically, it was the first major attempt to map out the lands claimed by each attending tribe,
                    though it should be noted much of this was done by Americans familiar with the tribes.
                    This would be a step in the direction of the reservation system,
                    including the one defined by the 1868 treaty of the same name.

                <p>
                    The 1868 Treaty of Fort Laramie set aside land for the Great Sioux reservation, including the Black Hills,
                    a location considered sacred by the Sioux.
                     When settlers intruded upon this land later in 1876 after finding gold in the hills,
                     the Sioux fought back in a conflict that would culminate into the battle of Little Bighorn.
                     Despite the American army’s loss, the government continued to claim control of the Black Hills,
                     and confiscated the land in 1877, going back on their word. This continues to be a point of conflict between the Sioux Nation and the U.S. government.
